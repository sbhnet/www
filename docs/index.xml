      <description>Welcome to the blog! This is the first post and I wanted to talk about the initial projects started in the github projects.
Velero ARM Support Currently Velero represents the quintessential backup and restore tool for Kubernetes, but support for Velero on ARM didn&amp;rsquo;t exist so I created a project on github to cover an initial implementation.
I created Pull Request #2227 to add the basic ARM builds needed to pull ARM images of Velero, and the follow up is to enable ARM support for the Velero AWS Plugin.</description>

      <description>This site is a special interest blog about enabling Kubernetes on ARM.
The blog was created as part of the kubernetes-arm github organization to post about projects and the developing experience of using Kubernetes on ARM systems.
It&amp;rsquo;s been difficult in previous years to find good content and information about the state of Kubernetes on ARM and the hope of creating this blog, the org and the projects is to invite like-minded engineers to come together to solve the problems of Kubernetes on ARM.</description>
