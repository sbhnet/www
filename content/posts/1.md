Welcome to the blog! This is the first post and I wanted to talk about the initial projects started in the [github projects][projects].

### Velero ARM Support

Currently [Velero][velero] represents the quintessential backup and restore tool for [Kubernetes][k8s], but support for Velero on ARM didn't exist so I created [a project on github to cover an initial implementation][project1].

I created [Pull Request #2227][pr] to add the basic ARM builds needed to pull ARM images of Velero, and the follow up is to enable ARM support for the [Velero AWS Plugin][awsplugin]. [AWS][aws] seemed like a good place to start as I personally have operational knowledge of their [ARM EC2 Instances][ec2], but the intention after this will be to add projects for the [Velero Azure Plugin][azureplugin] and [GCP Plugin][gcpplugin].

An added benefit of starting upstream work on the AWS plugin first is that it has the side effect of helping to enable [Minio][minio] backend support for Velero on ARM as well.

### AWS-EBS-CSI-Driver ARM Support

If you don't mind being tied down to a specific cloud provider implementation, the [aws-ebs-sci-driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver) provides one of the simplest ways to enable persistent storage on an AWS cluster by using [EBS][ebs]. Currently it doesn't support ARM though in the [docker image builds][dockerebs] so I've created [a project to get that done][project3].

### Longhorn ARM Support

Storage is a difficult story on an ARM based Kubernetes cluster right now, but even more difficult if your aim is to avoid cloud provider specific implementations. [Longhorn][longhorn] promises to provide cloud-native persistent block storage that can utilize the existing storage underlying the [nodes][nodes] but [currently does not support ARM][longhornarmissue] so I started organizing [a project for this one too][project2].

### Contributions

The purpose of creating this blog and the [github organization][gh] were to try and encourage others with interest to join me in these projects and more that follow to make ARM Kubernetes clusters grade A. If you're interested in joining in [send an email!](mailto:info@kubernetes-arm.com)
